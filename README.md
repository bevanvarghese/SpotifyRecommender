### How to Use
1. Follow the instructions in **RecommenderAPI.ipynb** to create your Spotify Authorization Token.  
2. Once you've created said token, follow along with the rest of the notebook to have playlists generated for you in no time.  
3. As an alternative, you can run **app.py** for a terminal-based implementation.
